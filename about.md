# About me

Hi! I'm Kelvin Lee&mdash;a postdoctoral researcher in the Chemistry department at MIT. I work on quite a diverse
set of things, linking Chemistry, Astronomy, Data Science, and ML/AI. My main research expertise and passion is
thinking about how computer automation can help us (anyone!) derive insightful conclusions from complex data.

Why Julia? Mainly because it affords amazing code abstraction, scalability, and from what I see, the Julia
community is extremely open and diverse: if you have an idea, chances are there is a package developed for it.
These are not "necessary" persay, but definitely fits well with the theme of a blog writing about answering
random questions.

Below are some of my scholarly, professional, and social media profiles; please feel free to get in contact with me!
