Naturally, by the end of the ten games you&#39;d want to end up with more money than you began with&#33; What makes this scenario unconventional is that you know the likelihood of your team winning a game, which also stays constant.</p> <p>The point of the WSJ article was to &quot;teach investors a lesson&quot;; even if the odds of winning are tilted in your favor, <em>how</em> you bet in each game can affect the outcome incredibly. The article introduced a strategy or &quot;policy&quot; for betting/investing based on information theory, which the authors mention that even large investors like Warren Buffet use to make decisions.</p> <p>I thought that these ideas were intriguing, and wanted to test it out numerically outside of their limited interactive simulation. As we&#39;ll find that there are a lot more caveats to this &#40;which also rationalizes why there every investor isn&#39;t a billionaire&#41; equation, and in another article later, see if we can use reinforcement learning to come up with our own policy.</p> <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> I&#39;m not a finance or investing person by any stretch of the imagination, and so this is not investing advice: this notebook is purely pedagogical.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Kelvin Lee.
